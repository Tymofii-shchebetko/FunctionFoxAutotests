# FunctionFoxAutotests (example)

HiðŸ‘‹ 

I've prepared a small demo of how future autotests might look like for FunctionFox.
This is a functional E2E autotest that demonstrates a login with invalid credentials.

Selenium WebDriver was used as a web framework; 
C# as a programming language;
And using Page Object Model as a design pattern;

Applying:
Such autotests can be run on CI with each new commit, once at a specified time, or locally to avoid running regressions manually
